# Network Optimiser
In this project, we are implementing an algorithm to find a maximum bandwidth path in a graph.
This algorithm can be used for optimisation of network routing protocols.

We randomly generate graphs of two types - sparse and dense, and run our algorithms on top of them.

We used three algorithms to calculate the maximum bandwidth path:
* Modified Dijkstra's algorithm without using heap
* Modified Dijkstra's algorithm using heap.
* Modified Kruskal's algorithm using heap and union find.
